          John Smith
          "you think it, we build it"
          He Starts his day with a cup of AG1 and a long look at schematics. Afterward, the onslaught of meetings begins, lots of yes men and money floating around. Work doesn't mean much other than talking and planning for John and on his lunch break he orders a T-bone steak with a baked potato at Ruth Chris' and his ladder half of the day is mostly relaxation. He does work around 12 hours a day and
          spends the rest of his time reading books to his children and taking his wife out to lavish dinners.
