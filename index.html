John Smith
"you think it, we build it"
He Starts his day with a cup of AG1 and a long look at schematics. Afterward, the onslaught of meet- ings begins, lots of yes men and money floating around. Work doesn't mean much other than talking and planning for John and on his lunch break he orders a T-bone steak with a baked potato at Ruth Chris' and his ladder half of the day is mostly relaxation. He does work around 12 hours a day and
spends the rest of his time reading books to his children and taking his wife out to lavish dinners.
